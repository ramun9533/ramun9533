### Hi there 👋 William Elí

I am an industrial electronics engineer, who is passionate about making open source for home automation and other applications, based on Arduino and other microcontroller platforms, creating technology to elevate people and build a more independent community. Some technologies I enjoy working with include powerful interfaces for Arduino, C ++, Processing, HTML, and CSS. I like to share my knowledge and help with projects.
