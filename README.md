   ***I am an industrial electronics engineer, who is passionate  
    about making open source for home automation and other
    applications, based on Arduino and other microcontroller 
    platforms, creating technology to elevate people and build 
    a more independent community. Some technologies I enjoy 
    working with include powerful interfaces for Arduino, C ++, 
    Processing, HTML, and CSS. I like to share my knowledge and 
    help with projects***
